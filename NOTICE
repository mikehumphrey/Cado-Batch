NOTICE OF MODIFICATIONS
================================================================================

This fork has been independently maintained and includes the following 
significant modifications from the original Cado-Batch project:

1. Rebranded from "Cado-Batch" to "Host Evidence Runner (HER)" to avoid 
   trademark confusion with Cado Security's commercial products.

2. Modernized PowerShell collector (source/collect.ps1) with:
   - Enhanced artifact collection (Phase 1 & Phase 2 analysis)
   - Robust bin path resolution supporting multiple deployment layouts
   - SafeJoinPath helper to prevent array-to-string parameter binding errors
   - Comprehensive logging and error handling
   - Browser history collection (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
   - Prefetch, SRUM, Amcache analysis
   - Suspicious scheduled task detection

3. Added one-step launcher scripts:
   - run-collector.ps1 (PowerShell launcher with robust path resolution)
   - RUN_COLLECT.bat (Batch wrapper for restrictive environments)

4. Created Build-Release.ps1:
   - Automated release packaging
   - Optional code signing support
   - Single tools/bins copy with automatic resolution
   - Generates HER-Collector.zip for distribution

5. Sanitized all user-facing output to remove proprietary Cado branding 
   while maintaining proper attribution in LICENSE and NOTICE files.

6. Updated .gitignore to exclude generated release artifacts.

7. Enhanced documentation:
   - Comprehensive README with sysadmin deployment instructions
   - Context.md for project governance and technical architecture
   - Clear tool layout and path resolution documentation
